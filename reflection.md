- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represent a new player, which has basic attributes of name, size, strength, starting location and a new inventory with max capacity that can be modified. Each item in the inventory has a key value of its name and its corresponding utilizability.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
The class has additional methods:
checkStrength(), which returns whether the player has enough strength to carry on movements or simply need a rest
printItem(), which print all the items in the inventory
clone(), overload the clone method from the Object class so as to create a deep copy of the Player to get back to the previous stage for the undo() method
hashTableclone(), create a deep copy of the hashtable for the changes in the inventory
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think the undo() method may function properly...? Actually, I don't even kwow how I succeed... but it seems that it does work!
Something needs to be improved is the printing, sometimes not doing printlns would make the output look crowded together.
