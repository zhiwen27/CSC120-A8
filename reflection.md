Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represent a new player, which has basic attributes of name, size, strength, starting location and a new inventory with max capacity that can be modified. Each item in the inventory has a key value of its name and its corresponding utilizability.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
The class has additional methods:
checkStrength(), which returns whether the player has enough strength to carry on movements or simply need a rest
printItem(), which print all the items in the inventory
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I am a bit confused about how to write undo() method.
